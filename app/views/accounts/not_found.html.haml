  %strong Looks like we don't have any to-dos for you just yet.  Here's what you do:
  %ol
    %li
      Send a tweet to <strong>@need2</strong> (using Twitter, of course).
    %li 
      ="Visit <strong><a href=\"http://twittodo.com/#{h @id}\">http://twittodo.com/#{h @id}</a></strong>, and voil√†!"
  %strong You say you just sent someting to @need2?
  %ol
    %li Wait just a bit.  Twitter only lets us fetch new to-dos every few minutes, so your note may show up momentarily.
    %li 
      Still nothing?  Send us an email with your Twitter username to
      = "#{mail_to('help@twittodo.com')}."
      We'll look into it and get back to you as soon as we can!
